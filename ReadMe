Description：
           The data set is mainly used to train the DBCC model and detect the beidge cracks.
Source of the data：
           The data comes mainly from viaduct in Xi'an, Shaanxi Province.
Type of data:
           Our team has published two kinds of data sets,as follows:
                1)Bridge_Crack_Image_Data, the data set is mainly used to train the DBCC model;
                2)Original_Crack_DataSet_1024_1024,the data set is used to test the DBCC model and 
                      contains 2068 bridge crack image with a resolution of 1024 * 1042 and it is 
                      available online：https://pan.baidu.com/disk/home#list/path=%2F&vmode=list.
license：
           The data set is primarily used to study the detection and extraction algorithms of bridge 
           cracks and is not allowed for ommercial purposes;If you want to use this data set, we would 
           you to refer to the corresponding paper.
